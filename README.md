# MCMMO-Forge
I started this project as an MCMMO enthusiast out of frustration that I cannot add MCMMO to my Forge Modpack.
I do not intend to write a mod, which fully supports all features, MCMMO-Bukkit currently has nor am I going to 
support other minecraft versions than 1.7.10. 

This is my first Minecraft modding project and I am doing it in my spare time. As this is good practice for me, I am reimplementing
this mod only based on the [MCMMO-Wiki](http://mcmmo.wikia.com/wiki/McMMO_Wiki) pages and I don't intend to reuse any of the 
[original source code](https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO). With this in mind, don't expect this project to be finished in the near future.

Starting with version 1.1.0 this mod will also work in SP, but for now the XP is stored in a world independent file, so
the skill progress will shared amongst all worlds.
